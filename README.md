# Programming Project: A Gradeschool Fraction Calculator

Young grade-schoolers often have trouble adding factions. You are to write a complete Java program that will give the grade-schooler the ability to enter any two fractions. As output, your program is to print the two fractions and their sum as a fraction (this fraction will not be reduced to lowest terms). You can assume that the value zero is never entered for the denominator and that each numerator and denominator will be a whole number. There is one or more whitespace characters separating the numberator, /, and denominator.

Here is how your program is to interact with the user:
